#Qt5 Configuration Tool color schemes

For those not satisfied with the default look of Qt5 apps, `qt5ct` offers
easy customization.

At least some styles (e.g. Windows, Fusion) allow customization of widget
colors. Qt5CT provides some default schemes, but you can also create your
own. This is what's committed in here.

The `.conf` files here may be copied under ~/.config/qt5ct/colors/, or any
other location that Qt5CT checks, which automatically makes them available
for selection.
